# Homepage-Clock

## Description 
A simple homepage for web browsers featuring a digital clock and some frequently visited links.  I followed a tutorial, which is linked below, to quickly develop the HTML and CSS as well as guide me through the JavaScript needed.  I decided to watch the video, comment out the directions on the JS page, and build it after watching the video, rather than following along.  I added my own elements (no pun intended) such as the links, the styling and the dark/light modes.  ENJOY!
